# Overview
This is a "README" for Theresa. Provide transparency of who I think I am and what my parameters are. This is a living doc, and should be updated as I learn more about myself.

# Instructions
If you believe there is a misalignment - small or large - to any of my statements, please comment via branch.

# Personal info I'm willing to share:
## Interests
* Food - I can talk about this everyday, all day. I'm very opinionated on the things I love and the things I hate. 
	* Also, in my opinion, food is a great way to learn about new cultures (global, regional, and personal).
* Process - I'm a process nerd. I love finding patterns and the logic behind things so that something can be operationalized as efficiently as possible.
	* My hope is that one day the process is solid enough where I'm no longer needed in this respect.
* Playback quality - Love a good playback stream - video and audio. 
	* If it looks or sounds bad, I'll skip it - no matter how good the content is.
* Taxonomy - I love organizing things - tangible and intangible.
	* I sort my Haribo gummy bears in the order for which I like to eat them.
	* If you live in the US, I've "organized" your mail 
	* If you've got Verizon, your phone numbers.
	* If you ever used AOL, your personal information.
* Technology - I have a general like for tech so I try to learn a little bit of whatever I can. Just enough so I might be able to understand some conversation. 
	* I like to ask questions so I can learn more from people who know more.
	* I like to share what I do know, so others can be informed too.
	* I can code but not very well. Just like I can ski/play golf/football, but not very well.
## Hobbies
* Cross stitching - It's calming.
* Knitting - At home I'm often knitting on meetings. It keeps me from getting distracted by emails and slacks so I can stay focused on the meeting.

# Professional Experience (TLDR Résumé)
## Consulting Firm
* I worked in a very-fast-paced, throw-you-into-the-fire, client-doesn't-need-to-love-you-but-needs-to-love-the-work-you-do, do-whatever-it-takes-to-get-it-done type of environment.
* I learned more in 5 years than most people learn in a lifetime as it relates to a mix of industries ranging from gov't agencies, telecomms, and manufacturers.
## Startup/Dotcom
* Was a TPM but wore many additional hats - Product, QA, SysAdmin, NetAdmin, JiraAdmin
* Built and Managed a small team of TPMs as the company grew
## Media
* TPM responsible for a number of digital initiative launches
* Products I've worked on have won a number of different industry and tech awards
* Built and managed engineering teams and engineering leaders
* Process architect for tech & product-wide organizations
* Large team leadership experience

# What I think my role/job is
* n/a

## Why I love what I do
* Cross section of a number of my interests
* Helping teams be successful

## Why I dislike what I do
* I have to remind people to follow process and deliver to expectations and sometimes it feels like I'm nagging folks

# Feedback
## This is how I receive feedback
* I love feedback because that's the only way that I can improve myself.
* It needs to be actionable. Is the information something I can actually take action on?
* Examples please. What specifically about what I did did you not like? 
* Don't tell me the solution, tell me the problem, feel free to suggest something but let's work on the solution together. That way you know I'm listening and trying to address the issue and I can help you understand other parameters/variables I'm also dealing with.
## This is how I give feedback 
* I thought/didn't think [X] went well/bad, can I suggest we tweak it to do [Y] instead?
* I would like more/less of [A] because I saw/heard/experienced [B]. How can we make that happen?

# Preferences
## Communication 
* Slack and Email
## Meetings
* Have an agenda and ideally share it before the meeting so we know what we'll be talking about and I can prep for it
* Provide notes and action items with owners
* Heads up are always appreciated. No one likes being surprised or not having context.
* I commute to the office Tues-Thurs. Schedule after 10am ET and before 5pm ET on those days.
* Camera on, except if I think I might make others uncomfortable (eating, coughing, etc.) or need to walk away (doorbell, fire, leak, etc.)
	* Will try to let you know so you know that I am still engaged or am not engaged
	* If I'm not looking at the camera, I'm taking notes or trying to keeping my hands otherwise occupied so I don't slip into checking Slack messages
* I assume I'm allowed provide input. 
* I rarely ask to be invited to meetings. 
	* If I do, it's because I think I can learn from it or contribute to it.
	* I trust others to put together the right attendee list. If I'm accidentally missed, that's fine, give me notes, and make sure I'm on the next time.
## Collaboration
* I prefer Slack conversations. Thread as much as possible. If there are multiple threads within the thread, separate them out.
* Provide additional context, but don't derail the goal.
* Contribute and help move things forward. 
* Good ideas are good, no matter who they come from. (ie: my title means very little to me)
## Operational Excellence
* Something production-impacting or potentially impacting, get on it ASAP - have at least a PLAN if nothing else so that if/when it does happen, there's immediate action, so as not to delay action.

# This is what I expect from various roles
## Managers/Directors
* TBD
## Product Owners
* Tell us the what and why 
## Technical Writers
* Make things understandable to other people
# These are the things that drive me nuts and will only make it harder for you to work with me:
* Not following through
* Not responding or acknowledging my responses/questions.
* Setting my expectations and then not following through or resetting expectations
* Lack of grace for the occasional mistake
* Leaving things undone (not following through)
# These are the things that I especially appreciate: 
* Willingness to help - because I need a lot of it
* Getting ahead of things - because it shows me you give extra care to it
* Caring about people - because it's something I sometimes forget to do
* Not just ideas, but action (Bias for action)
* Win as a Team by helping each other do what needs to be done.
